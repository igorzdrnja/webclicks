#Webclicks

A mini-app that can display the customer journey statisctics using the tablelike input (which contains the customer id, url clicked and the timestamp), in a nice sankey diagram.

The idea is to see how many users that had landed on a particular product category page actually end up on the product page / are successful in their search of the particular product;
and also to display their overall journey on the website.

At a particular step, the sankey diagram displays the page type and the number/percentage of users that are currently on that type of page.
It also shows how many customers in %, have transitioned between the page types between each step.
Statistics data with keywords used, categories visites breakdown per different parameters is also displayed and can be exported as a CSV file.

For a demo, use the sample `test.csv` file as an input into the app.
